* Lab 1

** Run Spark Jupyter Notebook in docker container

We use the [[https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/tree/master/all-spark-notebook][all-spark-notebook]] docker image. Run the bash script below to start the docker container.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
./docker-run.sh
#+END_SRC

The server logs appear in the terminal.

And then visit http://127.0.0.1:4567?token=<token> in a browser, where token is the secret token printed in the console.
Note that we use port =4567= instead of jupyter default =8888=.

Now you should be able to access our 2 notebooks at:

  - [[http://127.0.0.1:4567/notebooks/work/spark.ipynb]]
  - [[http://127.0.0.1:4567/notebooks/work/sparksql.ipynb]]

To test them out, you need to have the =data= folder provided for this lab placed under this directory.

*** Touble shooting

The default kernal used in spark jupyter notebook is =Apache Toree=, however we strongly recommend to use =spylon-kernel= instead.

You can change the kernel through Jupyter Notebook toolbar:  =Kernal= -> =Change Kernel= -> =spylon-kernel=.
