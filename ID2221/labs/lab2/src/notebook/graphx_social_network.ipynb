    "We begin by creating the property graph from arrays of vertices and edges. Later we will demonstrate how to load real data. Here we use the `Edge` class. Edges have a `srcId` and a `dstId` corresponding to the source and destination vertex identifiers. In addition, the `Edge` class has an `attr` member that stores the edge property (in this case the number of likes). Use `sc.parallelize` to construct the following RDDs from the `vertexArray` and `edgeArray` variables, and then build a property graph. The basic property graph constructor takes an RDD of vertices (with type `RDD[(VertexId, V)]`) and an RDD of edges (with type `RDD[Edge[E]]`) and builds a graph (with type `Graph[V, E]`). "
