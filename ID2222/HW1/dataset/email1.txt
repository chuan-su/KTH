I wanted to reach out to discuss a client of mine who have highlighted your skill-set. They are modern innovators who build state-of-the-art media intelligence solutions for a global client base.

They're looking to bring in a full-stack engineer to join of their most exciting teams dedicated to building kick-ass products through a combination of Kotlin, Java, Javascript (some node) and run in containers backed by a bunch of cloud services.

The team value teamwork and software quality above all else and have created an environment that allows each member to see major personal growth whilst enjoying the day-to-day.

Would love to tell you more, when's best to give you a call?
