My name is Ida and I’m working at Budbee and we’re now searching for our next backend developer. We need someone with skills in JAVA, MySQL and Amazon and I can see that you been working with all of those.
Budbee is a Stockholm-based IT startup tired of bad home deliveries - a last mile delivery experience suited for your needs. Our aim is to make the end customers feel relaxed, informed and in control of their deliveries from the moment they place their order until the goods is in their hands.

We have developed our own route algorithm that make home-delivery more efficient for companies, and for customers the user experience from our product is unique. We have some big customers already within the food-delivery market and we’re taking ground at the e-commerce business.
If you would like to know more don’t hesitate to contact me. I’d really like to get in touch with you to talk more about us but also to learn more about you.
