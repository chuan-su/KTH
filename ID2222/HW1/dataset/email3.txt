I wanted to reach out today as I am currently seeking JavaScript developers for an exciting role at a world leading company, operating in the Business Intelligence space. Harnessing the power of data is pretty much flavour of the month right now, and companies are fighting over each other to gain any insight which might give them an edge over their competitors. This company are using AI, to offer enhanced insights to their clients, all over the globe, and have achieved a staggering rate of growth over the past couple of years, with more in the pipeline

They are looking to add developers who have experience with Angular and Node.JS to the team, although the main thing they are interested in is that you love coding, and love learning new things! The company work with a huge variety of different tech across different teams and products, and so there would be scope to broaden your exposure to other areas... Elixir, Ruby, Java, Kanban, AWS, Big Data tech, mobile development, and more...

I thought that perhaps this could be of relevance to yourself... Let me know if you would like to know some more specific details!
