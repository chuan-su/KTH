* Router Config

One Router can have more than one interface and each interface has its own unique ipaddress.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ ssh -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 -c aes128-cbc student@192.168.0.1 -p 2005
$ enable # privilige mode
$ show running-conifg # view current router conifg
$ conifg terminal

### Interfaces conifg mode
$ interface gigabitEthernet 0/0
$ ip address 192.168.22.1 255.255.255.0 # set ip address 192.168.22.1 for RTA gigabitEthernet interface
$ no shutdown
$ end # back to privilige mode

$ interface fastEthernet 1/0
$ ip address 192.168.21.1 255.255.255.0 # set ip address 192.168.21.1 for RTA fastEthernet interface
$ no shutdown
$ end # back to privilige mode

## verify
$ show ip route
#C    192.168.22.0/24 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/0
#C    192.168.21.0/24 is directly connected, FastEthernet1/0
#+END_SRC

*Important* use a =cross cable= to connect between routers. Cross cable is only used to connect between routers.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# verify you can ping other router once we have connected router through cross cable
$ ping 192.168.22.2 # ping RTD router gigabitethernet interface
$ ping 192.168.23.1 # ping RTD router ethernet interfce, dont think this will work becuase 23 is another subnet than 22
#+END_SRC

* Conifg VM

One computer can have more than one interface and each interface has its own unique ipaddress.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ ssh -Y student@192.168.0.21 # table 2 host for 1.
$ ping 192.168.0.2 # ping DHCP server

# conifg/set current vm eth1 interface ipaddress
$ sudo ifconifg eth1 192.168.21.2/24 # equielent to: sudo ip addr add 192.168.21.2/24
$ ifconifg # verify ip is set correctly

# config router with ip: 192.168.21.1 as the default gateway
# add remember to connect host and router via regular ethernet cable.
$ sudo route add default gateway 192.168.21.1

# ping another host (this wont work)
# becuase router RTA is not aware of this subnet 192.168.23.x.
# router RTA is able to forward packet to subnet 192.168.22.x because it is connected via cross cable.
$ ping 192.168.23.2
#+END_SRC

** Add route in RTA router agian

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# any packet towards subnet 192.168.23.x should be forward to router with ipaddress: 192.168.22.2
$ ip route 192.168.23.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.22.2

# now ping the host 192.168.23.2 worked.
# since router knows that it will forward any packet towards subnet 23 to interface 192.168.22.2 that it already connected via cross cable.
$ ping 192.168.23.2
#+END_SRC

Some thoughts:

- One router contains 2 interfaces which connect to 2 different subnets. one interface is input port and the other is output port
  In this lab. RTA connects subnet 192.168.21.x with subnet 192.168.22.x while RTA connects subnet 192.168.22.x and 192.168.23.x
  It becomes =192.168.21.x= -> =192.168.22.x= -> =192.168.22.x= -> =192.168.23.x=.
  Then we just need to tell router which interface to forward packge =ip route <destination_ip> <interface_ip>=.
