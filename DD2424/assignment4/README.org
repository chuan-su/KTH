** Gradient Checks

To verify our anylytic gradient computations are correct, we applied the [[http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-3/][relative error comparison]] approach that comparing
the numerical gradient and analytic gradient and verified that the relative error is below =1e-6=.

We performed gradients check on our =RNN= model for the gradients =dW,dU,dV,db= and =dc=.

For details of our gradients check procedure, please refer to [[https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/chuans/DL/blob/master/assignment4/gradients_check.py][gradients_check.py source code]]

** Smooth Loss

- We trained our =RNN= network with =20= epochs and achieved smooth loss =39.993612643405= starting from iteration =434000= at epoch =10=.
- We have actually achieved smooth loss =40.999018771318475= from iteration =300700= at epoch =6=.
